# Personal log for analysis pipeline

### July 27th:  
Had a meeting with the professor: recommended new dataset; started cleaning and becoming familiar with with new dataset; watched youtube tutorial for how to clean data; created ProcessData file

### July 28th: Further processed and wrangled the data. See ProcessData.ipynb: Initial data lost, unsure as to why (spent an hour on it and half of the cells wouldnt load). Had to retype code. Spend over 2 hours on this section due to technical difficulties and loss of work. Managed to change the value names in education as recommended by prof to futher collapse the data

### Aug 1-5th: Continued work on Milestone 2. Forgot to log progress but added files EDA and Analysis to Analysis pipeline. Challenges with presenting data in various ways. Plan to do this for Milestone 3.
