# Personal log for analysis pipeline

### July 27th:  
Had a meeting with the professor: recommended new dataset; started cleaning and becoming familiar with with new dataset; watched youtube tutorial for how to clean data; created ProcessData file

###July 28th: Further processed and wrangled the data. See ProcessData.ipynb: Initial data lost, unsure as to why (spent an hour on it and half of the cells wouldnt load). Had to retype code. Spend over 2 hours on this section due to technical difficulties and loss of work. Managed to change the value names in education as recommended by prof to futher collapse the data
