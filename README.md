## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The topic I chose was Functional Difficulties for Children aged 5 to 17 years in Canada during 2019. Functional difficulties include domains such as seeing, hearing, etc. (see more domains in description of dataset). I am interested in this topic because I work with children in this age category as a child care worker and soon as a lead instructor for a community classroom.  I am curious about what specific areas educators should focus on providing additional support to their students. This dataset would be helpful for guiding me in learning about, recognizing, and addressing more common functional difficulties/challenges when working with children. Since the data is further organized by sex, the topic could expand to include the functional difficulties that are more common among males verses females and vise versa. Overall, this topic could aid educators as they formulate their lesson plans and focus on how to best support children in their learning.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset for my topic was retrieved from Statistics Canada and downloaded as a CVS UTF-8 file. It includes data collected from a Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth conducted in 2019. Statistics Canada has an open license for all data made available on their site. The reference for this dataset is Statistics Canada. Table 13-10-0765-01  Functional difficulties for children aged 5 to 17 years, Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth 2019. When downloaded and opened in excel the data set includes 253 rows and 15 columns. This dataset has multiple domains(rows) that includes: seeing, hearing, walking, self-care, communication, learning, remembering, concentrating, accepting change, controlling behaviour, making friends, anxiety, depression, and functional difficulties in at least one domain. The columns include the following headers: REF_DATE, GEO, DGUID, Age group, Sex, Domains, Characteristics, UOM, UOM_ID, SCALAR_FACTOR, SCALAR_ ID, VECTOR, COORDINATE, VALUE, STATUS,and DECIMALS. The column SEX includes information on males, females, and both as well as the total number of persons and the percent of persons when compared to the total. The geographical location for all data in the dataset is Canada. The values in the SCALAR_ID column are all 0, so this column might be unnecessary.
